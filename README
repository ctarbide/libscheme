This is a clone/fork of libscheme based on libscheme-0.5.tar.gz. This version
has some bug fixes and minor improvements. The canonical source for this version
is at https://github.com/ctarbide/libscheme.

Dependencies and requirements, a C99 compiler and the excelent BDWGC
(Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector), go to https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc
for more information.

Installation, a simple "make" should build everything in a few seconds, then run
"./test test.scm". A readline wrapper like "rlwrap" is very helpful for
interactive sessions. There is no "make install", the documentation explains the
intended use case.

Documentation is doc/libscheme.pdf.
